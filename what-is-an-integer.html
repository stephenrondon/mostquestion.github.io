</h3>
<p>
  The number line representation of integers is a powerful tool for understanding the concept of integers. It allows us to visualize integers as points on a line, with positive integers to the right of zero and negative integers to the left of zero. This representation makes it clear that the set of integers is infinite, and that there is no largest or smallest integer.
</p>
<p>
  The number line representation of integers is also important for understanding the operations of addition and subtraction. When we add two integers, we move to the right on the number line by the number of units of the first integer, and then to the left on the number line by the number of units of the second integer. The result is the integer that we end up on. Similarly, when we subtract two integers, we move to the right on the number line by the number of units of the first integer, and then to the right on the number line by the number of units of the second integer. The result is the integer that we end up on.
</p>
