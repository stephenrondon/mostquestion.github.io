    <strong>Boiling:</strong><br />
    <p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Grilling:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Grilling imparts a smoky and charred flavor to lobster tail. Grilling over medium-high heat allows the lobster tail to develop a crispy exterior while keeping the inside succulent. This technique is ideal for those who enjoy a bolder, more robust flavor profile.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Baking:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Baking is a versatile technique that allows for precise temperature control, resulting in evenly cooked lobster tail.
