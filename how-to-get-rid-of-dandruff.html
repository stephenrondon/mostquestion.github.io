</p>
<h3>
  Take oral medications
</h3>
<p>
  Dandruff is a common scalp condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including dry skin, scalp irritation, and fungal infections. Oral medications are a type of treatment for dandruff that can be used when other treatments, such as over-the-counter dandruff shampoos and medicated creams or lotions, have not been effective. Oral medications for dandruff work by reducing inflammation and preventing fungal growth.
</p>
<p>
  There are two main types of oral medications that are used to treat dandruff: antifungals and anti-inflammatories. Antifungal medications work by killing the fungus that can cause dandruff. Anti-inflammatory medications work by reducing the inflammation that can lead to dandruff.

</p>
<h3>
  Make lifestyle changes
</h3>
<p>
  Dandruff is a common scalp condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including dry skin, scalp irritation, and fungal infections. While there are a number of different treatments for dandruff, making lifestyle changes can also be helpful in improving the condition.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most important lifestyle changes that you can make is to reduce stress. Stress can trigger dandruff by causing the scalp to produce more oil. This oil can then clog the hair follicles and lead to the formation of dandruff flakes. Reducing stress can help to control dandruff by reducing the amount of oil that is produced by the scalp.
</p>
<p>
  Another important lifestyle change that you can make is to eat a healthy diet. Eating a healthy diet can help to improve the overall health of your scalp and hair. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help to provide your scalp and hair with the nutrients that they need to stay healthy. Avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of alcohol can also help to improve dandruff.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, getting regular exercise can also help to improve dandruff. Exercise helps to improve circulation and blood flow to the scalp. This can help to deliver nutrients to the scalp and hair follicles and promote scalp health.
</p>
<p>
  Making lifestyle changes can be a helpful way to improve dandruff. By reducing stress, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise, you can help to create a healthy environment for your scalp and hair.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Here are some additional tips for making lifestyle changes to improve dandruff:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get regular haircuts. This will help to remove dead skin cells and excess oil from the scalp.
  </li>
  <li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo. Avoid using harsh shampoos or conditioners, as these can irritate the scalp and make dandruff worse.
  </li>
  <li>Avoid using styling products that contain alcohol. Alcohol can dry out the scalp and make dandruff worse.
  </li>
  <li>Protect your hair from the sun. Sun exposure can damage the scalp and make dandruff worse.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can help to make lifestyle changes that can improve your dandruff and promote scalp health.
</p>
