    <strong>Facet 1: Deep breathing</strong><br />
    Deep breathing is a simple but effective relaxation technique that can be done anywhere, anytime.

Repeat this process for several minutes, or until you feel calmer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Meditation</strong><br />
    Meditation is another effective relaxation technique that can help to reduce anger. Meditation involves focusing your attention on a single object, thought, or activity. This helps to clear your mind and reduce stress and anxiety. There are many different types of meditation, so you can find one that works best for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Yoga</strong><br />
    Yoga is a mind-body practice that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. Yoga has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and anger. It can also improve flexibility, strength, and balance.

    <strong>Facet 3: Celebrate your successes</strong><br />
