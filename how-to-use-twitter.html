</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Categorization:</strong> Hashtags act as digital labels, allowing you to categorize your tweets into specific topics or themes. This facilitates easier content discovery for users who are interested in a particular subject.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Discoverability:</strong> When users search for a hashtag, they are presented with a stream of tweets that contain that hashtag. This makes your tweets more discoverable by users who may not be following you but are interested in the topics you tweet about.
