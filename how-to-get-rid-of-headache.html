</p>
<h3>
  Pain relievers
</h3>

</p>
<h3>
  Cold compress

  <li>
    <strong>Mechanism of action:</strong> Cold compresses work by constricting blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the head and neck. This can help to reduce pain and inflammation.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, cold compresses are a safe and effective way to relieve headache pain. They are easy to use and can be applied at home or on the go. If you have a headache, try applying a cold compress to your head or neck. You may be surprised at how well it works.
</p>
