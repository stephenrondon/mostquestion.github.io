</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Ingredients:</b> The most important ingredient in gravy is the pan drippings from your meat or poultry. You can also add other ingredients to your gravy, such as vegetables, herbs, and spices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Thickening agent:</b> Gravy is thickened with a starch, such as flour or cornstarch. The amount of starch you add will determine the thickness of your gravy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Flavorings:</b> You can add a variety of flavorings to your gravy, such as herbs, spices, and wine. Be careful not to add too much, or your gravy will become too salty or spicy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Cooking method:</b> Gravy can be made on the stovetop or in the oven. If you are making gravy on the stovetop, be sure to whisk it constantly to prevent it from burning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Serving:</b> Gravy can be served with a variety of dishes, such as roasted meats, poultry, and vegetables. It can also be used as a base for other sauces, such as mushroom gravy or onion gravy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Storage:</b> Gravy can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze gravy for up to 3 months.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just a few of the key aspects to consider when making gravy. With a little practice, you can make a delicious and flavorful gravy that will enhance any meal.
</p>
<h3>
  Ingredients
</h3>
<p>
  The ingredients you use in your gravy will have a big impact on its flavor and texture. The most important ingredient is the pan drippings from your meat or poultry. These drippings are full of flavor and will help to thicken your gravy. You can also add other ingredients to your gravy, such as vegetables, herbs, and spices. These ingredients will help to add flavor and complexity to your gravy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Pan drippings:</strong> The pan drippings from your meat or poultry are the most important ingredient in gravy. These drippings are full of flavor and will help to thicken your gravy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Vegetables can be added to gravy to add flavor and texture. Common vegetables used in gravy include onions, carrots, and celery.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Herbs:</strong> Herbs can be added to gravy to add flavor and aroma. Common herbs used in gravy include thyme, rosemary, and sage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Spices:</strong> Spices can be added to gravy to add flavor and heat. Common spices used in gravy include black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By using a variety of ingredients, you can create a delicious and flavorful gravy that will complement any meal.
</p>
<h3>
  Thickening agent
</h3>
<p>
  A thickening agent is an essential component of gravy, as it is what gives gravy its characteristic thick and rich texture. Without a thickening agent, gravy would be thin and watery, and would not adhere to the meat or vegetables it is served with. The most common thickening agents used in gravy are flour and cornstarch.
</p>
<p>
  Flour is a good all-purpose thickening agent that is readily available and inexpensive. It is important to whisk flour into the pan drippings until it is completely dissolved, to avoid lumps. Cornstarch is a more powerful thickening agent than flour, so you will need to use less of it to achieve the same thickness. Cornstarch can also be dissolved in a small amount of water before being added to the pan drippings, to avoid lumps.
</p>
<p>
  The amount of thickening agent you add to your gravy will determine its thickness. If you want a thin gravy, you will only need to add a small amount of thickening agent. If you want a thick gravy, you will need to add more thickening agent. It is important to add the thickening agent gradually, whisking constantly, until you reach the desired consistency.
</p>
<p>
  By understanding the role of thickening agents in gravy, you can create a delicious and flavorful gravy that will complement any meal.
</p>
<h3>
  Flavorings
</h3>
<p>
  Flavorings play a crucial role in enhancing the taste and complexity of gravy. By adding herbs, spices, and wine, you can create a flavorful gravy that complements your main dish perfectly.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Herbs:</strong> Herbs add a fresh, aromatic flavor to gravy. Common herbs used in gravy include thyme, rosemary, and sage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Spices:</strong> Spices add warmth and depth of flavor to gravy. Common spices used in gravy include black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wine:</strong> Wine adds a rich, savory flavor to gravy. Red wine is a good choice for beef or lamb gravy, while white wine is a good choice for chicken or fish gravy.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When adding flavorings to your gravy, it is important to start with a small amount and then add more to taste. This will help you to avoid making your gravy too salty or spicy. You can also adjust the type and amount of flavorings you use to suit your own personal taste.
</p>
<p>
  By experimenting with different flavorings, you can create a delicious and flavorful gravy that will make your next meal a special occasion.
</p>
<h3>
  Cooking method
</h3>
<p>
  The cooking method you choose for your gravy will have a significant impact on its flavor and texture. Gravy can be made on the stovetop or in the oven. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Stovetop gravy</strong> is made by whisking the pan drippings from your meat or poultry with a thickening agent, such as flour or cornstarch. This method is quick and easy, and it allows you to control the consistency of your gravy more easily. However, it is important to whisk the gravy constantly to prevent it from burning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Oven gravy</strong> is made by roasting your meat or poultry in a pan with vegetables and herbs. The juices from the meat and vegetables will create a flavorful gravy that is rich and complex. However, oven gravy can be more time-consuming to make, and it is more difficult to control the consistency of the gravy.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  No matter which cooking method you choose, it is important to remember to whisk your gravy constantly to prevent it from burning. A burnt gravy will ruin the flavor of your entire meal.
