<h3>
  Ailment
</h3>
<p>
  In the context of Diabetes Mellitus, an ailment refers to a health condition that is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. This condition can manifest in various forms, including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Understanding the different facets of ailments related to Diabetes Mellitus is crucial for effective management and prevention.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong><br />
    <p>
      In Type 1 Diabetes, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that allows glucose to enter cells and be used for energy. Without insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong><br />
    <p>
      Type 2 Diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to effectively use insulin. This can be due to insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or a deficiency in insulin production. As a result, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gestational Diabetes</strong><br />
    <p>
      Gestational Diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It is caused by hormonal changes that can lead to insulin resistance. Gestational Diabetes usually goes away after pregnancy, but women who have had it are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes later in life.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Understanding the different types of ailments related to Diabetes Mellitus is essential for effective management and prevention. Proper diagnosis and treatment can help individuals manage their blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of complications.
</p>
