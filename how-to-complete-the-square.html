  Completing the square is an algebraic technique used to transform a quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial. It involves adding and subtracting a constant term to the equation so that one side becomes a perfect square trinomial, which can then be easily factored. For example, to complete the square for the equation x^2 + 4x, we add and subtract (4/2)^2 = 4 to the equation:
</p>
<p>
  x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4 = 4
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  This gives us the perfect square trinomial (x + 2)^2 = 4, which can be easily factored as (x + 2)(x + 2) = 4.
</p>
<p>
  Completing the square is a useful technique for solving quadratic equations, finding the vertex of a parabola, and graphing quadratic functions. It is also used in other areas of mathematics, such as calculus and linear algebra.

<h3>
  Vertex
</h3>
<p>
  The vertex of a parabola is the point where the parabola changes direction. It is the highest point on a parabola that opens downward, and the lowest point on a parabola that opens upward. The vertex of a parabola can be found by completing the square.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  Calculus and completing the square are connected because calculus can be used to find the derivative of a function. The derivative of a function is a measure of the rate of change of the function. Completing the square can be used to find the derivative of a quadratic function. This is useful because the derivative of a quadratic function can be used to find the vertex of the parabola that is the graph of the function.
</p>For example, consider the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3. The derivative of this function is f'(x) = 2x + 2. To find the vertex of the parabola that is the graph of this function, we can complete the square:```f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3f(x) = (x + 1)^2 - 4```The vertex of the parabola is the point (-1, -4).Completing the square is a valuable technique for understanding and graphing parabolas. It is also used in a variety of other applications, such as physics and engineering.

  Completing the square is a technique that is used to solve quadratic equations. It can also be used to find the vertex of a parabola, which is the point where the parabola changes direction. Linear algebra can be used to understand and solve systems of linear equations. These systems can be used to represent a wide variety of real-world problems, such as finding the optimal solution to a linear programming problem.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider the system of linear equations:
</p>
<p>
  x + 2y = 53x + 4y = 10
</p>
<p>
  This system of equations can be represented by the matrix equation:
</p>
<p>
  \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 \\3 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x \\y\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5 \\10\end{pmatrix}
</p>
<p>
  This matrix equation can be solved using Gaussian elimination. Gaussian elimination is a technique that uses elementary row operations to transform a matrix into an equivalent matrix that is in row echelon form. Once the matrix is in row echelon form, the system of linear equations can be easily solved.
</p>
