</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Cold water:</b> Starting with cold water allows the corn to heat gradually, which results in more even cooking. This method is preferred for corn on the cob, as it helps prevent the kernels from becoming tough or mushy. However, using cold water generally requires a longer boiling time compared to starting with boiling water.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Boiling water:</b> Starting with boiling water reduces the overall cooking time, as the water is already at a high temperature. This method is often used for frozen corn or corn kernels, as it helps to quickly thaw and cook the corn. However, it is important to monitor the corn closely to prevent overcooking, as boiling water can cause the kernels to become soft and mushy.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, the choice of water temperature depends on the type of corn being cooked and the desired texture. For optimal results, it is recommended to follow the specific instructions provided in recipes or adjust the boiling time based on the factors discussed above.
