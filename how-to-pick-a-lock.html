  Tools
</h3>

<h3>
  Tension

</p>
<p>
  There are many different types of picks available, each designed for a specific type of lock. The most common type of pick is the hook pick, which is used to pick pin tumbler locks. Hook picks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and the best choice for a particular lock will depend on the size and shape of the keyhole and the pins inside the lock.
</p>
