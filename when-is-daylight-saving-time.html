  Daylight saving time (DST) is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Typically, clocks are moved forward one hour near the start of spring and are moved back one hour near the start of autumn, although the exact dates and times may vary by country or region.
</p>
<p>
  The primary benefit of DST is that it can reduce energy consumption by taking advantage of natural daylight. This is because people are more likely to be active outdoors in the evenings when there is more daylight, which means they are less likely to use artificial lighting. DST has also been shown to have a positive impact on mental and physical health, as it can lead to increased levels of physical activity and reduced risk of depression.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  The history of DST can be traced back to the 18th century, when Benjamin Franklin first proposed the idea as a way to save on candle usage. However, it was not until World War I that DST was widely adopted, as a way to conserve energy during the war effort. Today, DST is used in over 70 countries around the world.
