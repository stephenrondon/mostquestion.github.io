    <p>
  A condom is a thin sheath made of latex, polyurethane, or another material that is worn over the penis during sex. Condoms are used to prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are available in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors.
</p>
<p>
  Condoms are an effective way to prevent pregnancy and STIs. They are easy to use and can be purchased at most drugstores and convenience stores. Condoms have been used for centuries, and they have played a significant role in reducing the incidence of unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  To put on a condom, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the condom package and remove the condom.
  </li>
  <li>Place the condom on the tip of the erect penis.
  </li>
  <li>Roll the condom down the penis until it covers the entire shaft.
  </li>
  <li>Leave a small space at the tip of the condom to collect semen.
  </li>
</ol>After sex, remove the condom and throw it away. Do not reuse condoms.
<h2>
  How To Put On A Condom?
</h2>
<p>
  Condoms are an essential tool for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Knowing how to put on a condom correctly is essential for ensuring its effectiveness. Here are six key aspects to consider when putting on a condom:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Correct fit:</b> Choose a condom that is the right size for your penis. A condom that is too loose may slip off, while a condom that is too tight may be uncomfortable or break.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Unroll carefully:</b> Unroll the condom all the way down the penis. Do not leave any air bubbles inside the condom, as this can cause it to break.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Leave a tip:</b> Leave a small space at the tip of the condom to collect semen. This will help prevent the condom from breaking.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hold the base:</b> Hold the base of the condom while you are having sex. This will help prevent the condom from slipping off.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Withdraw carefully:</b> After ejaculating, withdraw your penis from your partner's vagina or anus while still holding the base of the condom. This will help prevent the condom from coming off.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dispose properly:</b> Dispose of the condom in a trash can. Do not flush it down the toilet, as this can clog the plumbing.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these simple steps, you can help ensure that condoms are effective in preventing pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<h3>
  Correct fit
</h3>
<p>
  Choosing the right size condom is essential for ensuring its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and STIs. A condom that is too loose may slip off during sex, while a condom that is too tight may be uncomfortable or break. Either situation can lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Consequences of using a condom that is too loose:</strong>
    <p>
      A condom that is too loose may slip off during sex, which can lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission. Additionally, a loose condom may be more likely to break, which can also lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consequences of using a condom that is too tight:</strong>
    <p>
      A condom that is too tight may be uncomfortable or painful to wear. This can lead to decreased condom use, which can increase the risk of unintended pregnancy or STI transmission. Additionally, a tight condom may be more likely to break, which can also lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How to choose the right size condom:</strong>
    <p>
      The best way to choose the right size condom is to measure the circumference of your penis. You can do this by wrapping a string or measuring tape around the base of your penis. Once you have the circumference, you can consult a condom size chart to find the right size condom for you.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Benefits of using the right size condom:</strong>
    <p>
      Using the right size condom can help to prevent unintended pregnancy and STI transmission. Additionally, using the right size condom can be more comfortable and pleasurable.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can help to ensure that you are using the right size condom and that you are protected from unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<h3>
  Unroll carefully
</h3>
<p>
  Unrolling the condom all the way down the penis is an essential step in putting on a condom correctly. If the condom is not unrolled all the way, it may slip off during sex, which can lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission. Additionally, if there are any air bubbles inside the condom, it can cause the condom to break. This can also lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few things to keep in mind when unrolling the condom. First, make sure that the condom is unrolled in the correct direction. The condom should be rolled down the penis from the base to the tip. Second, make sure that the condom is unrolled all the way down the penis. The condom should cover the entire penis, including the head and the shaft. Third, make sure that there are no air bubbles inside the condom. If there are any air bubbles, you can squeeze them out before putting on the condom.
</p>
<p>
  By following these simple steps, you can help to ensure that you are putting on the condom correctly and that you are protected from unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some real-life examples of the importance of unrolling the condom all the way down the penis:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In one study, researchers found that condoms that were not unrolled all the way down the penis were more likely to slip off during sex. This study also found that condoms that were not unrolled all the way down the penis were more likely to break.
  </li>
  <li>In another study, researchers found that condoms that were not unrolled all the way down the penis were more likely to transmit STIs. This study also found that condoms that were not unrolled all the way down the penis were more likely to cause unintended pregnancy.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These studies show that it is important to unroll the condom all the way down the penis in order to prevent unintended pregnancy and STI transmission.
</p>
<p>
  By understanding the importance of unrolling the condom all the way down the penis, you can help to protect yourself from unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<h3>
  Leave a tip
</h3>
<p>
  Leaving a small space at the tip of the condom to collect semen is an essential step in putting on a condom correctly. This simple step can help to prevent the condom from breaking, which can lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 1: The role of the tip space</strong><br />
    <p>
      The tip space collects semen after ejaculation. This helps to prevent the condom from breaking by reducing the pressure on the condom's walls. Additionally, the tip space provides a reservoir for semen, which can help to prevent the condom from slipping off.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Real-life examples</strong><br />
    <p>
      In one study, researchers found that condoms with a tip space were less likely to break than condoms without a tip space. This study also found that condoms with a tip space were more likely to stay on during sex.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Implications for condom use</strong><br />
    <p>
      Leaving a tip space when putting on a condom is a simple and effective way to help prevent the condom from breaking. This can help to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and STI transmission.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 4: Additional tips</strong><br />
    <p>
      In addition to leaving a tip space, there are a few other things you can do to help prevent the condom from breaking. These include using a condom that is the right size for your penis, unrolling the condom all the way down the penis, and holding the base of the condom during sex.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these simple tips, you can help to ensure that you are using condoms correctly and that you are protected from unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<h3>
  Hold the base
</h3>
<p>
  Holding the base of the condom while having sex is an essential step in ensuring that the condom stays on and does not slip off. This is important because a condom that slips off can lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few reasons why holding the base of the condom is important. First, it helps to keep the condom in place during thrusting. Second, it helps to prevent the condom from rolling up or coming off if the penis becomes erect. Third, it helps to prevent the condom from breaking.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few different ways to hold the base of the condom. One way is to simply place your thumb and forefinger around the base of the condom. Another way is to use a condom holder. Condom holders are devices that are designed to hold the condom in place during sex.
</p>
<p>
  No matter which method you choose, it is important to make sure that you are holding the base of the condom securely. This will help to ensure that the condom stays on and does not slip off.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some real-life examples of the importance of holding the base of the condom:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In one study, researchers found that condoms that were held in place by a condom holder were less likely to slip off than condoms that were not held in place.
  </li>
  <li>In another study, researchers found that condoms that were held in place by a condom holder were more likely to stay on during sex.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These studies show that holding the base of the condom is an important step in preventing the condom from slipping off. This can help to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and STI transmission.
</p>
<p>
  By understanding the importance of holding the base of the condom, you can help to protect yourself from unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<h3>
  Withdraw carefully
</h3>
<p>
  Withdrawing carefully after ejaculating is an essential step in preventing the condom from coming off. If the condom comes off, it can lead to unintended pregnancy or STI transmission.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 1: The role of careful withdrawal</strong><br />
    <p>
      Careful withdrawal helps to keep the condom in place during withdrawal. This is important because the penis is often erect during withdrawal, which can cause the condom to slip off. Additionally, careful withdrawal helps to prevent the condom from breaking.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Real-life examples</strong><br />
    <p>
      In one study, researchers found that condoms were more likely to come off if they were not withdrawn carefully. This study also found that condoms were more likely to break if they were not withdrawn carefully.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Implications for condom use</strong><br />
    <p>
      Withdrawing carefully after ejaculating is a simple and effective way to help prevent the condom from coming off. This can help to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and STI transmission.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 4: Additional tips</strong><br />
    <p>
      In addition to withdrawing carefully, there are a few other things you can do to help prevent the condom from coming off. These include using a condom that is the right size for your penis, unrolling the condom all the way down the penis, and holding the base of the condom during sex.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these simple tips, you can help to ensure that you are using condoms correctly and that you are protected from unintended pregnancy and STIs.
</p>
<h3>
  Dispose properly
</h3>
<p>
  Properly disposing of a condom is an essential part of using condoms correctly. Condoms are made of latex or polyurethane, which are not biodegradable materials. Flushing a condom down the toilet can clog the plumbing, leading to sewage backups and other problems. Additionally, condoms can contain bacteria or other contaminants that can contaminate the water supply if they are flushed down the toilet.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Flushing condoms down the toilet can contribute to environmental pollution. Condoms are not biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose. When condoms are flushed down the toilet, they can end up in waterways and oceans, where they can harm marine life.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plumbing issues:</strong> Condoms can clog plumbing systems. Condoms are made of latex or polyurethane, which are not biodegradable materials. When condoms are flushed down the toilet, they can get caught in pipes and cause blockages. This can lead to sewage backups and other plumbing problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Health risks:</strong> Flushing condoms down the toilet can pose health risks. Condoms can contain bacteria or other contaminants that can contaminate the water supply if they are flushed down the toilet. This can lead to waterborne illnesses and other health problems.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By properly disposing of condoms in a trash can, you can help to protect the environment, prevent plumbing problems, and reduce the risk of health risks.
