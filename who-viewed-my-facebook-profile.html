  The ability to see who has viewed your Facebook profile is a feature that has been requested by users for many years. While there are a number of third-party apps that claim to offer this functionality, none of them are actually able to do so. This is because Facebook does not make this information available to developers.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few reasons why Facebook might not want to make this information public. First, it could be seen as a privacy violation. Users might not want other people to know that they have been looking at their profile. Second, it could lead to stalking or harassment. People could use this information to track down and contact users they don't know.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  Despite these concerns, there are still some users who believe that the benefits of being able to see who has viewed their profile outweigh the risks. For example, it could help users to identify potential friends or business contacts. It could also help users to track down people they have lost touch with.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lost Connections:</strong> It could help users to track down people they have lost touch with.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to make this information public is up to Facebook. There are valid arguments to be made on both sides of the issue. However, it is important to be aware of the potential privacy and security risks before making a decision.
</p>
<h3>
  Privacy
</h3>
<p>
  One of the main reasons why Facebook does not allow users to see who has viewed their profile is privacy. Users might not want other people to know that they have been looking at their profile for a variety of reasons. For example, they might be concerned about being stalked or harassed. They might also be concerned about their privacy being violated.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Potential for Stalking and Harassment:</strong> If users are able to see who has viewed their profile, this information could be used to track them down and contact them. This could be particularly dangerous for users who are already being stalked or harassed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Privacy Violations:</strong> Some users might feel that it is a violation of their privacy if others are able to see that they have been looking at their profile. They might not want other people to know what they are interested in or what they are looking for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Negative Social Interactions:</strong> Knowing who has viewed their profile could lead to negative social interactions. For example, a user might be embarrassed if they see that someone they don't like has been looking at their profile. They might also be disappointed if they see that someone they are interested in has not been looking at their profile.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, there are a number of valid reasons why users might not want other people to know that they have been looking at their profile. Facebook's decision to keep this information private is a way to protect user privacy and prevent stalking and harassment.
</p>
<h3>
  Stalking
</h3>
<p>
  One of the main concerns about allowing users to see who has viewed their Facebook profile is that this information could be used by stalkers to track down and contact users they don't know. This is a serious concern, as stalking can have a devastating impact on victims' lives.
</p>
<p>
  Stalkers often use social media to track their victims' movements and activities. They may also use social media to contact their victims directly, sending them threatening or harassing messages. In some cases, stalkers may even use social media to plan and carry out physical attacks on their victims.
</p>
<p>
  The ability to see who has viewed their Facebook profile would make it easier for stalkers to track down and contact their victims. This is because stalkers could simply look at the list of people who have viewed their victim's profile and then use this information to find their victim's contact information. This could make it much easier for stalkers to initiate contact with their victims, even if their victims have taken steps to block them.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the ability to see who has viewed their Facebook profile could also make it easier for stalkers to learn about their victims' interests and activities. This information could be used to plan and carry out more targeted attacks on their victims.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the ability to see who has viewed your Facebook profile could pose a serious risk to users' safety. This is why Facebook has decided to keep this information private.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Here are some real-life examples of how stalkers have used social media to track down and contact their victims:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 2015, a man in California was arrested for stalking a woman he met on Facebook. The man used the woman's Facebook profile to find her address and then began sending her threatening messages.
  </li>
  <li>In 2016, a woman in New York was stalked by a man she met on Facebook. The man used the woman's Facebook profile to find her phone number and then began calling her repeatedly.
  </li>
  <li>In 2017, a man in Florida was arrested for stalking a woman he met on Facebook. The man used the woman's Facebook profile to find her workplace and then began following her home from work.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just a few examples of how stalkers have used social media to track down and contact their victims. The ability to see who has viewed your Facebook profile would make it even easier for stalkers to do this.
</p>
