  Hiccups are involuntary spasms of the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. They are usually harmless and go away on their own within a few minutes. However, there are a number of things you can do to stop hiccups if they are bothersome.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most common ways to stop hiccups is to hold your breath. This increases the pressure in your chest cavity and helps to reset the diaphragm. You can also try drinking a glass of water or eating a spoonful of sugar. These methods can help to stimulate the vagus nerve, which helps to control the diaphragm.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  If these methods do not work, you can try some more forceful techniques. One is to pull on your tongue. This stimulates the vagus nerve and can help to stop hiccups. Another is to apply pressure to the diaphragm. You can do this by lying on your back and pressing on your chest with your hands. You can also try bending over and pressing on your diaphragm with your knees.
