As the web grew, so did the importance of SEO. Today, SEO is a complex and ever-evolving field, with new techniques and strategies being developed all the time.

  Once you have chosen your keywords, you need to incorporate them into your website's content, title tags, and meta descriptions. You should also use keywords in your website's URL and image alt tags. By using keywords throughout your website, you can help search engines understand what your website is about and rank it higher in SERPs.
