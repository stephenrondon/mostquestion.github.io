<h3>
  Used to count very large quantities
</h3>
<p>
  Billions are used to count very large quantities, such as the population of a country or the amount of money in a budget. This is because a billion is a very large number, equal to one thousand million. It is difficult to imagine a quantity this large, but it is important to be able to count very large quantities in order to understand the world around us.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the population of the world is estimated to be over seven billion people. This means that there are seven 1s followed by nine zeros in the world's population. This is a very large number, and it is difficult to imagine how many people this actually is. However, by using billions, we can get a sense of the magnitude of the world's population.
</p>
<p>
  Billions are also used to count very large sums of money. For example, the United States national debt is over twenty trillion dollars. This means that there are twenty 1s followed by twelve zeros in the national debt. This is a very large sum of money, and it is difficult to imagine how much money this actually is. However, by using billions, we can get a sense of the magnitude of the national debt.
</p>
