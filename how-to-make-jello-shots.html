  Jello shots are a fun and easy way to add some excitement to any party. They are made with just a few simple ingredients, and can be customized to any flavor or color. Best of all, they are relatively inexpensive to make, and can be made ahead of time, so you can relax and enjoy your party without having to worry about last-minute preparations.
</p>
<p>
  The most important ingredient in jello shots is, of course, jello. You can use any flavor of jello you like, but the most popular flavors are strawberry, raspberry, and orange. Once you have chosen your flavor, simply follow the instructions on the package to make the jello. Once the jello has set, you can cut it into cubes and add it to your shot glasses. You can also add other ingredients to your jello shots, such as fruit, candy, or even alcohol. If you are adding alcohol, be sure to use a clear liquor, so that the color of the jello is not affected.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  Once you have added all of your desired ingredients, simply refrigerate the jello shots until they are firm. This usually takes about 3-4 hours. Once the jello shots are firm, they are ready to serve. You can garnish them with whipped cream, sprinkles, or fruit, if desired.

<p>
  Making jello shots is a great way to add some excitement to any party. By following these five key tips, you can make sure that your jello shots are delicious and fun.
</p>
<h3>
  Flavor
</h3>
<p>
  The flavor of your jello shots is one of the most important things to consider when making them. After all, you want your jello shots to be delicious! There are many different flavors of jello to choose from, so you can find one that everyone will enjoy. If you're not sure what flavor to choose, you can always mix and match different flavors to create your own unique concoction.
</p>
<p>
  The most popular flavors of jello shots are strawberry, raspberry, and orange. These flavors are all sweet and fruity, and they go well with the other ingredients in jello shots, such as alcohol and fruit. However, you can use any flavor of jello you like. Some other popular flavors include cherry, grape, lime, and pineapple.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've chosen your flavor, you can start making your jello shots. The process is simple: just dissolve the jello powder in hot water, then add cold water and your desired flavorings. Once the jello has set, you can cut it into cubes and add it to your shot glasses. You can also add other ingredients to your jello shots, such as fruit, candy, or even alcohol. If you are adding alcohol, be sure to use a clear liquor, so that the color of the jello is not affected.
</p>
<p>
  Jello shots are a fun and easy way to add some excitement to any party. By following these simple tips, you can make sure that your jello shots are delicious and fun.
</p>
<h3>
  Alcohol
</h3>
<p>
  When making jello shots, the type of alcohol you use can have a big impact on the final product. If you want to add alcohol to your jello shots without affecting the color, it is important to use a clear liquor. Vodka, gin, and white rum are all good choices, as they are all clear and have a relatively neutral flavor. This means that they will not overpower the flavor of the jello, and will allow the other ingredients to shine through.
</p>
<p>
  If you use a dark liquor, such as whiskey or brandy, the color of your jello shots will be affected. This can be desirable if you are making jello shots for a specific occasion, such as a Halloween party. However, if you are making jello shots for a more general purpose, it is best to use a clear liquor so that the color of the jello is not affected.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the type of alcohol you use, the amount of alcohol you add will also affect the final product. If you add too much alcohol, the jello shots will be too strong and may not be enjoyable to drink. It is important to start with a small amount of alcohol and add more to taste. This will help you to create jello shots that are the perfect strength for your guests.
</p>
<h3>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use fresh, frozen, or canned fruit. If you are using fresh fruit, be sure to wash and cut it into small pieces before adding it to your jello shots.
  </li>
  <li>Add fruit to your jello shots before they set. This will help the fruit to distribute evenly throughout the jello.
