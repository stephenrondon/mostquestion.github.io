  A percentage is a way of expressing a fraction as a hundredth. It is denoted by the symbol %. For example, 50% means 50/100, or 0.5.
</p>
<p>
  Percentages are used in many different fields, such as mathematics, science, and finance. They are also used in everyday life, for example, to compare prices or to calculate discounts.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  There are several different ways to calculate a percentage. One way is to divide the part by the whole and then multiply by 100. For example, to calculate the percentage of women in a group of 100 people, you would divide the number of women by 100 and then multiply by 100. This would give you the percentage of women in the group.

<h3>
  Definition
</h3>
<p>
  Understanding this definition is crucial for calculating percentages accurately. A percentage is essentially a way of expressing a fraction as a part of a hundred. For example, 50% represents the fraction 50/100, which can be simplified to 1/2. The symbol % denotes that the value is a percentage, distinguishing it from a regular fraction or decimal.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate a percentage, we use the formula: Percentage = (Part / Whole) x 100. This formula relies on the concept of a fraction, where the "Part" represents the numerator and the "Whole" represents the denominator. By multiplying the result by 100, we convert the fraction into a percentage.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, if we want to calculate the percentage of students who passed an exam, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100. This gives us the percentage of students who passed the exam.
</p>
<p>
  Comprehending the definition of a percentage as a fraction denoted by the symbol % forms the foundation for calculating percentages correctly. It allows us to convert fractions into percentages, compare values, and solve problems involving proportions and ratios.
