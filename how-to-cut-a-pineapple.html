<h3>
  Coring
</h3>

</p>
<h3>
  Eyes
</h3>
<p>
  The eyes of a pineapple are small, brown spots on the skin of the fruit. They are formed by the remnants of the flowers that pollinated the pineapple. While the eyes are edible, they can be tough and fibrous. For this reason, many people choose to remove them before eating pineapple.
</p>
<p>
  There are two main ways to remove the eyes from a pineapple. The first method is to use a sharp knife. To do this, simply cut a shallow circle around the eye and then use a spoon to scoop it out.

</p>
<p>
  Removing the eyes from a pineapple is not necessary, but it can make the fruit more enjoyable to eat. If you are planning to eat pineapple fresh, it is a good idea to remove the eyes. However, if you are planning to cook the pineapple, you can leave the eyes in. The eyes will soften during cooking and will not be noticeable.
</p>
<h3>
