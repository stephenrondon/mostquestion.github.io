<h3>
  Definition
</h3>
<p>
  This definition is the foundation for understanding what a polygon is. It establishes the basic properties of a polygon, which are that it is a two-dimensional shape with straight sides. This definition excludes other types of shapes, such as circles and curves, and it sets the stage for further exploration of the properties of polygons.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Components:</strong> Polygons are made up of three basic components: sides, angles, and vertices. Sides are the straight line segments that connect the vertices. Angles are formed where two sides meet. Vertices are the points where two or more sides meet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Examples:</strong> There are many different types of polygons, including triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and octagons. Each type of polygon has a different number of sides and angles.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implications:</strong> The definition of a polygon has implications for its properties. For example, the number of sides of a polygon determines its shape and its area. The angles of a polygon determine its shape and its interior angles.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In summary, the definition of a polygon is a fundamental concept in geometry. It establishes the basic properties of polygons and provides a foundation for further exploration of their properties and applications.
</p>

  Sides
</h3>
<p>
  This statement is closely related to the definition of a polygon, as it provides more information about the specific characteristics of polygons. Specifically, it highlights the fact that polygons can have any number of sides, but the most common types of polygons are triangles, quadrilaterals, and pentagons.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Components:</strong> The number of sides of a polygon is one of its defining characteristics. Polygons can have any number of sides, but the most common types of polygons have three, four, or five sides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Examples:</strong> Triangles are polygons with three sides, quadrilaterals are polygons with four sides, and pentagons are polygons with five sides. These are the most common types of polygons, and they are used in a wide variety of applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implications:</strong> The number of sides of a polygon has implications for its properties. For example, the number of sides of a polygon determines its shape and its area. The angles of a polygon determine its shape and its interior angles.
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>
  Angles
</h3>
<p>
  The angles of a polygon are an essential part of its definition. A polygon is a two-dimensional shape with straight sides, and the angles of a polygon are formed by the intersection of its sides. This means that the number of angles in a polygon is always two less than the number of sides.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a triangle has three sides and three angles, a quadrilateral has four sides and four angles, and a pentagon has five sides and five angles. The angles of a polygon are important because they determine the shape of the polygon. For example, a triangle with three equal angles is an equilateral triangle, and a quadrilateral with four right angles is a rectangle.
</p>
<p>
  The angles of a polygon are also important in many practical applications. For example, the angles of a roof determine how much water will drain off of it, and the angles of a bridge determine how much weight it can support. Understanding the angles of a polygon is essential for anyone who works with shapes, whether they are architects, engineers, or mathematicians.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, the angles of a polygon are an essential part of its definition and have many practical applications. Understanding the angles of a polygon is essential for anyone who works with shapes.
</p>
<h3>
  Area
</h3>
<p>
  The area of a polygon is an important property that measures the amount of space enclosed by its sides. It is closely related to the definition of a polygon, as it provides more information about the specific characteristics of polygons and their properties.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Components:</strong> The area of a polygon is determined by the length of its sides and the angles between its sides. The area of a polygon can be calculated using a variety of formulas, depending on the type of polygon.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Examples:</strong> The area of a polygon can be used to calculate the area of a variety of objects, such as the area of a room, the area of a field, or the area of a lake. The area of a polygon can also be used to calculate the volume of a three-dimensional object, such as the volume of a pyramid or the volume of a cube.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implications:</strong> The area of a polygon has implications for its properties. For example, the area of a polygon can be used to determine its center of gravity, its moment of inertia, and its radius of gyration.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In summary, the area of a polygon is an important property that measures the amount of space enclosed by its sides. It is closely related to the definition of a polygon and has many practical applications.
</p>
<h3>
  Perimeter
</h3>
<p>
  The perimeter of a polygon is a fundamental property that measures the total length of its sides. It is closely related to the definition of a polygon, as it provides more information about the specific characteristics of polygons and their properties.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Components:</strong> The perimeter of a polygon is determined by the length of its sides. The perimeter of a polygon can be calculated by adding up the lengths of all of its sides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Examples:</strong> The perimeter of a polygon can be used to calculate the length of a fence around a yard, the length of a track around a field, or the length of a border around a garden. The perimeter of a polygon can also be used to calculate the area of a polygon.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implications:</strong> The perimeter of a polygon has implications for its properties. For example, the perimeter of a polygon can be used to determine its shape, its area, and its moment of inertia.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In summary, the perimeter of a polygon is a fundamental property that measures the total length of its sides. It is closely related to the definition of a polygon and has many practical applications.
</p>
<h3>
  Classification
</h3>
<p>
  The classification of polygons is an important part of understanding their properties and applications. Polygons can be classified into different types based on their number of sides, their angles, and their symmetry.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Number of sides:</strong> Polygons can be classified based on the number of sides they have. Common types of polygons include triangles (3 sides), quadrilaterals (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), hexagons (6 sides), and so on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Angles:</strong> Polygons can also be classified based on the measure of their angles. Polygons with all right angles are called rectangles, polygons with all equal angles are called regular polygons, and polygons with no equal angles are called irregular polygons.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Symmetry:</strong> Polygons can also be classified based on their symmetry. Polygons with rotational symmetry are called regular polygons, and polygons with reflection symmetry are called centrally symmetric polygons.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The classification of polygons helps us to understand their properties and applications. For example, regular polygons have many interesting properties, such as the fact that their sides are all equal and their angles are all equal. Regular polygons are also used in many applications, such as architecture and design.
