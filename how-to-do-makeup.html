      Cleansing removes dirt, oil, and makeup residue from the skin, creating a clean and fresh base for makeup application. It helps prevent clogged pores and ensures that makeup adheres better to the skin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exfoliation</strong><br />
    <p>

  <li>
    <strong>Moisturizing</strong><br />
    <p>
      Moisturizing hydrates the skin, creating a smooth and supple base for makeup application. It helps prevent dryness and flakiness, ensuring that makeup blends seamlessly into the skin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Primer</strong><br />
    <p>
      Primer creates a barrier between the skin and makeup, helping to extend the longevity of makeup and improve its overall appearance. It can also minimize the appearance of pores and fine lines, creating a smoother canvas for makeup application.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Proper preparation not only enhances the application and finish of makeup but also contributes to the overall health and appearance of the skin. By removing impurities, hydrating the skin, and creating a smooth base, preparation sets the stage for a flawless and long-lasting makeup look.
</p>
<h3>
  Foundation
</h3>

    <p>
      Foundation provides coverage, ranging from sheer to full, to conceal blemishes, dark circles, and other skin imperfections. It helps even out skin tone, creating a more uniform and polished look.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Color Matching</strong><br />
    <p>
      Choosing the right foundation shade is crucial for a natural and flawless finish. It should match the skin tone and undertone to avoid a noticeable contrast or mask-like appearance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Formula</strong><br />
    <p>
      Foundations come in different formulas, such as liquid, cream, powder, and stick. Each formula has its own unique properties and finish, catering to different skin types and preferences.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Application</strong><br />
