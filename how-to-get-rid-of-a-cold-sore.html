<h3>
  Prevention
</h3>
<p>
  Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is a very common virus. It is estimated that up to 90% of the population has HSV, but only a small percentage of people develop cold sores. Cold sores are spread through contact with infected saliva or skin, so avoiding contact with people who have cold sores is the best way to prevent them.
</p>
<p>
  Washing your hands frequently is also important, as HSV can survive on surfaces for up to several hours. If you come into contact with someone who has a cold sore, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
</p>
<p>
  There is no cure for cold sores, but there are a number of treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms.
